# Set a Custom Shipping Rate in WooCommerce

This plugin will allow you set a custom shipping rate, for example, 1-Day shipping. 

In the screenshot, the 1-Day shipping is twice the cost of the flat rate shipping.  The standard flat rate in the screenshot is set in the WooCommerce settings for shipping.
